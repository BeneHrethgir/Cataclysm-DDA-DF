## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

1. Assume other participants are posting in good faith, even if you disagree with what they say.
2. Make an effort to treat other participants with respect.
    1. Do not take a harsh tone towards other participants, and especially don't make personal attacks against them.
    2. Recognize that criticism of your statements is not a personal attack on you.
    3. Avoid statements about the presumed typical desires, capabilities or actions of some demographic group.
3. Be especially kind to other contributors when saying they made a mistake.
4. Don't argue unceasingly for your preferred course of action when a decision for some other course has already been made.
5. If other participants complain about the way you express your ideas, please make an effort to cater to them.
6. Don't raise unrelated political issues.
7. If you feel these standards are being violated, please alert the project lead Kevin Granade at kevin.granade@gmail.com

## Delta Fork's Code of Conduct
1. Write good code.
    - **ALWAYS** Ask questions!
        - Prerequisite: *Search first.*
        - If you think your code sucks, re-design it and check it again!
        - If you are unsure about how a piece of code works, and you've searched everywhere, ask! Make it public so others having similar problems may find this!
2. ...*ALWAYS* ask questions.
    - Some questions you must ask yourself first.
    - If you find your question unanswered by anyone, or unsatisfied with any such answer, by all means ask yourself, experiment, and self-evaluate.
3. Don't be a jerk.
    - Don't harass people.
    - Try to resolve conflicts quickly.
4. Try your hardest
    - No matter what, do your best. Try until you get it, because you surely will.
    - Experiment! At the very core, [follow the scientific method (as it applies everywhere)](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/intro-to-biology/science-of-biology/a/the-science-of-biology)
5. Do things the hacker way
    - Duckduckgo / Qwant / Yandex / "Google" is your friend (though try **NOT** to use [google](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/google-software-bug-shared-private-online-documents-20090310-8tup.html) [products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)) [as](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/wifi-data-collection-update.html) [much](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/google-collects-a-frightening-amount-of-data-about-you-you-can-find-and-delete-it-now/) [as](https://twitter.com/DuckDuckGo/status/1371509053613084679) [humanly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/03/20/stop-using-google-chrome-on-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-ipad-and-macbook-pro/) [possible](https://hackernoon.com/data-privacy-concerns-with-google-b946f2b7afea))
    - Always check the documentation.
    - Reverse-engineer the game, and look at what others have done.
    - Break the game, and try to fix it.
    - If you find something undocumented, ***document it!***
        - You'll be helping others that have had that same issue!
6. Leave your politics at the door.
    - Remember, we're all on the same ship. Leave everything else behind you.
7. Have fun!
