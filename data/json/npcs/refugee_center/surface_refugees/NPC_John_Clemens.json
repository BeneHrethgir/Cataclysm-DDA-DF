Before everythin' went to shit, I worked on a ranch down in Tallahassee.  Got a lotta kinfolk due west that was suppose'ta come over for a wedding afterparty.  See, the government started makin' camps to put infected people in long before this.  Who would'a guessed the snakes in suits started putting more people, 'specially people they didn't like, in 'em.  I got everyone right before things got crazy, grabbed some guns and had a jarhead friend a' mine break off and join us.  We called 'em Jarhead Johnny.  We got past one checkpoint, but our car broke down.  A few more checkpoints and we'd hit the beach.  Sure 'nuff, we saw some boats…  we could've stole one.  I know how to hotwire boats.  But, then we saw someone pushing a boat, 'bout to head off and fish.  We asked him to take us somewhere up north and we'd pay 'em.  He said sure.  During our trip, this cocky moron asked for more money.  Johnny boy won't havin' that.  Fisherman pointed his gun at Johnny, and Johnny was pullin' his pistol out when he shot 'em.  Johnny fell, and right as soon as he did, he blew Fisherboy's head off.  Fell right in the water.  Couldn't save Johnny boy, though.  Bullet hit him in a bad spot.  We made it up here soon afterward and managed to find the center after taking refuge in an empty shelter for a few weeks.",
