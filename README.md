# Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (Delta Fork)

Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is free, libre & open-source turn-based survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food and equipment. Try to get a vehicle up and running for the long-haul. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies, to giant insects, to killer robots, and stranger things...

The Delta Fork of CDDA follows some of the developments of CleverRaven's. This mostly concerns bug fixes, and certain gameplay mechanics.
Outside of that, the fork will add more story, and just enough lore to keep you intrigued. 

UndeadPeople Tileset is the default tileset.
